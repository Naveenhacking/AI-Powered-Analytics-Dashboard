All widgets and components scale gracefully across breakpoints for a consistent UX.

## 🧠 AI Usage Report
This project was scaffolded, structured, and styled using AI (ChatGPT) in Bolt.new — an AI-native development environment.

What the AI helped with:
🔍 Feature planning and MVP scope definition

🧩 Modular component design for dashboard layout

🎨 UI/UX system recommendations (spacing, gradients, icons)

🧱 Generation of reusable UI elements (Button, Card, ChartContainer, Toggle)

📊 Chart layout scaffolding with placeholder data

✍️ Full README documentation and usage instructions

## Prompts Used:
“Create an MVP for an analytics dashboard with core features”

“List reusable UI components and layout elements”

“Generate responsive React components using Tailwind CSS”

“Write a single clean README.md with all sections included”

AI was used not to replace code but to speed up development, reduce boilerplate, and maintain a clean, consistent design pattern throughout the dashboard.
